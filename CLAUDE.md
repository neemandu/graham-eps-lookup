# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (and humans) working in this repository.

## What this is

A web app: enter a stock ticker and get a **Benjamin Graham analysis** —
intrinsic value `V = EPS × (8.5 + 2g) × 4.4 / Y`, margin of safety vs. the
current price, and a defensive-investor checklist. EPS, growth (`g`), and the
checklist metrics come from Yahoo Finance; the AAA bond yield (`Y`) comes from
FRED (with fallbacks). `g` and `Y` are auto-derived but user-overridable.

## Architecture

```
index.html / app.js / style.css  ->  public/   (static front-end)
                                       |
              fetch('/api/eps?ticker=ONDS')
                                       |
                                       v
   api/eps.js (Vercel)  ==  /api/eps route in server.js (local)
                                       |
                                       v
                              yahoo.js  ->  Yahoo Finance
```

- **`public/`** — static front-end (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no framework). Vercel
  serves this at the site root.
- **`api/analyze.js`** — main production endpoint (`/api/analyze`). `api/eps.js`
  is the original simple EPS-only endpoint, still present.
- **`server.js`** — Express server exposing the same routes for local
  development (`npm run dev` / `npm start`). Not used in production.
- **`analyze.js`** — shared orchestration: fetch Yahoo + FRED, resolve `g`/`Y`,
  run the value + checklist. Imported by both `api/analyze.js` and `server.js`.
- **`yahoo.js`** — all Yahoo access: `getStockData` (simple), `getFullStockData`
  (rich, incl. the analyst growth estimate), `getQuoteRaw` (e.g. `^TNX`).
- **`fred.js`** — AAA bond yield (`Y`) with a fallback chain (see below).
- **`graham.js`** — the value formula, margin of safety, and `defensiveCriteria`
  (the checklist thresholds).

Keep the endpoints thin — shared logic lives in `analyze.js` / `yahoo.js` /
`graham.js` so the Vercel function and local server never drift.

## Resolving g and Y

- **g (growth):** `growth.js#resolveGrowth` runs a chain for the ~5-yr expected
  rate: (1) **Yahoo P/E ÷ PEG** — since PEG = P/E ÷ g, this recovers the 5-yr
  growth Yahoo no longer exposes directly (`yahoo.js` provides `trailingPE` +
  `pegRatio`); (2) **Finviz "EPS next 5Y"** (`finviz.js`) for names without a PEG
  — best-effort, often 403s from Vercel's datacenter IPs, so it usually only
  fires locally / in the Action; (3) a **conservative 15% default**. The formula
  is very sensitive to `g`, so the UI always lets the user override it.
- **Y (AAA bond yield):** `fred.js` tries, in order: (1) FRED `DAAA` Moody's Aaa
  CSV, (2) Yahoo `^TNX` 10-yr Treasury + ~1.0%, (3) a static default. Note FRED
  is reachable from local Node but **times out from Vercel's AWS network**, so in
  production the Treasury proxy is normally what's used — the response labels the
  source so this is visible.

## How Yahoo is accessed (important)

Yahoo's quote page renders EPS client-side, so it is **not** in the raw HTML.
`yahoo.js` instead reproduces the browser's own session:

1. Get a session **cookie** from Yahoo.
2. Exchange it for a **crumb** token (what Yahoo's JS does).
3. Call the quote API (`/v7/finance/quote`) with cookie + crumb + realistic
   browser headers (User-Agent, Accept-Language, Referer, sec-ch-ua).

The session is cached (~25 min) and requests are paced with small randomized
delays to stay close to human browsing. If Yahoo starts returning 401/403, the
client refreshes the session once and retries. These endpoints are unofficial
and can change — if EPS stops resolving, re-check the cookie/crumb handshake
first.

## Tracking (watchlist + quarterly history)

A second page (`public/track.html`) maintains a **watchlist** and records a
**quarterly snapshot** of each stock's Graham metrics after the company reports.

- **Storage** is JSON committed to this repo (`data/watchlist.json`,
  `data/history/<TICKER>.json`) via `lib/store.js`, which has two modes:
  - *local* (no `GITHUB_TOKEN`): plain file reads/writes. Used in dev and inside
    the GitHub Action (which then commits the files).
  - *github* (`GITHUB_TOKEN` set): reads/writes via the GitHub Contents API.
    Used on Vercel so watchlist edits persist (each write is a commit).
- **APIs:** `api/watchlist.js` (GET/POST/DELETE), `api/history.js` (GET, single
  or overview), `api/snapshot.js` (manual trigger; optional `SNAPSHOT_KEY`).
- **Scheduling:** `.github/workflows/snapshot.yml` runs `scripts/snapshot.js`
  daily (11:00 UTC). The script (via `lib/snapshot.js#runSnapshots`) analyzes
  each watchlist ticker and appends a snapshot **only when its
  `mostRecentQuarter` (from Yahoo) advances past the last recorded quarter** —
  i.e. after a new report. The Action commits the new `data/` files itself using
  the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` (needs repo "Workflow permissions: read and
  write").
- **Filing links:** `sec.js#getFilings` resolves recent 10-Q/10-K links from SEC
  EDGAR (ticker → CIK → submissions). US listings only; non-US returns none.
- **Historical backfill:** `lib/backfill.js` + `scripts/backfill.js` reconstruct
  a stock's full quarterly history valued with the **Graham Number**
  √(22.5·EPS·BVPS) (needs no growth estimate). EPS, book value, and the
  per-quarter filing link come from SEC EDGAR XBRL (`companyconcept`); prices
  from the Yahoo chart API. TTM EPS sums four quarters of diluted EPS (Q4 derived
  as FY − 9-month YTD); values are as-originally-published (earliest filing). The
  Graham Number is null when EPS or BVPS isn't positive — flagged "N/A", never
  faked. Snapshots carry `method` ("Graham Number" vs the live "Graham formula")
  so the history table labels each row's basis. Run with `npm run backfill
  [TICKER...]`; the daily Action also runs it (idempotent) so newly-added tickers
  auto-backfill.

### Production note
On Vercel the app needs a `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var for watchlist *writes*. Without
it, reads still work (bundled `data/`) and the scheduled Action still records
snapshots (it uses its own token) — only add/remove-from-the-website fails.

## Quarterly report summary (fundamentals + AI)

The "Quarterly report summary" card distills six metrics per quarter from SEC
EDGAR XBRL with health colors, plus an optional AI narrative:

- **`lib/financials.js`** extracts EPS, revenue (+YoY), book value/share, current
  ratio, debt/equity, and operating cash flow per quarter. Flow metrics (EPS,
  revenue, OCF) are de-cumulated from year-to-date filings; tag names vary by
  company/era so candidate tags are merged per period. Status rules: current
  ratio ≥2/1–2/<1, D/E <1/1–1.2/>1.2, OCF +/−. Served by `api/financials.js`
  (deterministic, no key).
- **`api/summary.js`** sends those numbers to Claude (`claude-haiku-4-5` via
  `@anthropic-ai/sdk`) for a trend narrative across the six points. Needs an
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var; without it the table still works and the endpoint
  returns a 503 with a clear message. `vercel.json` sets `maxDuration: 30` for
  both functions.

## Commands

```bash
npm install        # install deps (express, for local dev)
npm start          # run locally at http://localhost:3000
npm run dev        # same, with --watch auto-reload
vercel             # deploy a preview
vercel --prod      # deploy to production
```

## Conventions

- ES modules throughout (`"type": "module"` in package.json), Node 18+.
- No build step and no front-end framework — keep it that way unless there's a
  real reason. Plain `fetch` from `public/app.js`.
- Validate the ticker against `/^[A-Za-z.\-]{1,12}$/` before hitting Yahoo.

## Deployment

Hosted on Vercel. Zero-config: `public/` is served statically, `api/*.js`
become serverless functions. `npm`-installed `express` is only for local dev;
the production endpoint is `api/eps.js`.

Note: Yahoo may rate-limit or block requests from datacenter IPs more
aggressively than from a home connection. If production EPS lookups fail while
local ones work, that's the likely cause.

## Not investment advice

Educational project. Data is from Yahoo's unofficial endpoints.
